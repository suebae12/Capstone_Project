from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
# The User model from django.contrib.auth is already registered by default
# If you need to customize the admin, you can unregister and re-register it:
# from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
# from django.contrib.auth.models import User
# admin.site.unregister(User)
# admin.site.register(User, CustomUserAdmin)
