from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
# We're using Django's built-in User model from django.contrib.auth.models
# for authentication and user management. This keeps things simple and 
# follows Django best practices.
#
# If you need to extend the user model in the future (e.g., add custom fields),
# you can create a UserProfile model with a OneToOne relationship to User.
